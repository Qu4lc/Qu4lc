# **Hello everybody ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my personal github!**

## About me:
I am a Mexican videogame developer with 2 years of experience specialized in Scripting, UI/UX Desing and Building within the [Roblox platform](https://www.roblox.com/) where along these years I have participated in some projects contributing to more than 19.5 Million visits within the platform. My motivations have always been my taste for development and my interest to constantly improve myself, always looking to create quality and effective systems in their respective uses.

## My knowledge:
- I have experience in popular libraries, among them are [Knit](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/), [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.3/), [ProfileService](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/), Etc.
- I have experience in UI/UX development.
- I have experience working in DataStores.
- I have experience developing systems such as Combat, Weapons, Movement and others;
  
which does not mean that I can't make mistakes or that I am the best at developing these systems, I am always learning and improving my skills and reinforcing my knowledge.

## My work method:
In general, I always try to understand what the client needs by gathering as many references as possible always maintaining a formal atmosphere and with the greatest possible respect, where I am committed to provide a first class service and deliver a job well done according to what is required.

### How commissions are made:
- At the moment of requesting a commission, references and a complete description of what you are looking for will be requested and the cost will be negotiated along with the delivery times where a preview and access to a private place will be provided for the client to verify the system.

### Costs and delivery times:
- The cost of the commission will be negotiated depending on the complexity and the time it will take me to complete it.
- The delivery time will be defined depending on the complexity of the system. The more time you have to do it, the better the overall quality.
